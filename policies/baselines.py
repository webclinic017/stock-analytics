#You must know the behaviour of the markets youâ€™re trading; some have trending behaviour and some a mean-reverting behaviour
#The market is unlikely to exceed 2 ATR in a day. So, you can use it as a gauge to determine how far the market can potentially move in a day.
#The previous week high/low are important levels to pay attention to
#If the volatility of the markets is low over the last few days, then expect volatility to expand soon
#You want to trade during the most volatile hours of the session
#Be aware of major news release as the spread tends to widen (and you could get stopped out of your trades)
#If you want low risk and high reward trading setups, then enter your trades near Support & Resistance (on the higher timeframe)
